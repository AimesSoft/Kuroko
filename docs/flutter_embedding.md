# Flutter Embedding

Erika is not a Flutter video renderer. Flutter is an optional host UI.
The player owns decode, timing, native rendering, subtitles, danmaku, audio, and
HDR presentation.

## API Families

There are two C ABI entrypoint families:

- `ErikaHandle`: control and event API. Use this when the host owns its own
  presenter loop or only wants to probe/control playback.
- `ErikaPresenterHandle`: presenter-owned API. Use this when Erika should
  own `Player + MetalRenderer + audio output` and the host only supplies a
  native surface plus a display-tick callback.

Both families are declared in `crates/erika_capi/include/erika.h`.

## macOS HDR Path

The macOS HDR path uses a native Metal-backed surface, not Flutter Texture.
Flutter/AppKit view composition can show video but is vulnerable to black
flicker, while a window-hosted native layer with a transparent Flutter region is
the stable HDR direction.

The plugin implements two view strategies:

### ErikaVideoView (Platform View)

Standard Flutter platform view backed by `NSView`/`CAMetalLayer`. The plugin
creates a native video view registered as `erika_flutter/video_view`, attaches
it to the presenter, and drives rendering from a display link.

### ErikaWindowOverlayVideoView (Window Overlay)

For HDR/EDR on macOS, the plugin creates a window-hosted native overlay that
sits outside Flutter's compositor:

1. Dart `ErikaWindowOverlayVideoView` reserves a rectangle in the widget tree.
2. The macOS plugin creates a window-level `CAMetalLayer` as a sibling/underlay.
3. Flutter paints the widget region transparent, leaving a hole for native video.
4. The widget tracks its position and sends geometry updates with a surface
   generation number, so stale hide calls from disposed widgets cannot affect
   newly attached surfaces.
5. Attach retry with exponential backoff handles window readiness timing.

## iOS Path

The iOS plugin uses `UiKitView` backed by `CAMetalLayer`. The Erika C ABI
static library is linked into the app through a CocoaPod script phase that
builds the Rust `erika_capi` crate for the target iOS architecture.

Touch events pass through the video view (`hitTestBehavior: transparent`).

## Minimal Presenter Flow

```c
ErikaPresenterHandle *presenter = erika_presenter_create();
erika_presenter_attach_metal_layer(
    presenter,
    (uint64_t)cametal_layer,
    width,
    height,
    backing_scale);
erika_presenter_open(presenter, "/path/to/media.mp4");
erika_presenter_play(presenter);

// On every display tick:
ErikaPresenterStats stats;
erika_presenter_render_tick(presenter, host_time_seconds, &stats);

// On resize:
erika_presenter_resize_surface(presenter, width, height, backing_scale);

// On dispose:
erika_presenter_detach_surface(presenter);
erika_presenter_destroy(presenter);
```

## Flutter Texture Path

Flutter Texture is a lower-capability compatibility path.

Useful for:
- SDR fallback.
- Platforms where native view composition is not ready.
- Test surfaces or constrained embedding environments.

Not the preferred HDR/EDR route because video enters Flutter's compositor. The
C ABI reserves `erika_attach_flutter_texture` for this path.

## wgpu Fallback

The Apple HDR path remains native Metal. `wgpu` is the cross-platform fallback
direction for Windows, Linux, Android, and non-HDR paths. The wgpu renderer has
video frame rendering and danmaku compositing implemented, but does not yet
support VideoToolbox zero-copy import or HDR/EDR output.

## Dart API

```dart
final player = ErikaPlayer(
  outputMode: ErikaOutputMode.appleEdr,  // optional: force EDR
  edrHeadroom: 4.0,                      // optional: EDR headroom
);

await player.open('/path/to/video.mp4');
await player.play();

// Playback control
await player.pause();
await player.seek(Duration(seconds: 30));
await player.setVolume(0.8);
await player.setPlaybackRate(1.5);

// Neural upscaler (anime luma 2x; macOS/iOS only)
await player.setUpscaler(ErikaUpscalerMode.artCnnC4F16); // off / artCnnC4F16 / artCnnC4F32
final status = await player.getUpscalerStatus();
// status.requestedMode  -- what was requested
// status.activeBackend  -- off / inactive / building / scalar / simdgroupMatrix
// status.upscaledFrames -- frames produced by the network so far

// Track management
final tracks = await player.tracks();
await player.selectAudioTrack(trackId);
await player.selectSubtitleTrack(trackId);
await player.addExternalSubtitle('/path/to/subtitle.srt');

// Danmaku
await player.loadDanmakuFile('/path/to/danmaku.xml');
await player.addDanmakuTrackJson(jsonString, name: 'source', offset: Duration.zero);
await player.setDanmakuConfig(fontSize: 30, displayArea: 0.5);

// Events
player.events.listen((event) {
  // event.kind, event.state, event.position, event.duration, ...
});

await player.dispose();
```

## Neural Upscaler Status

`setUpscaler` requests a mode; the kernels are compiled on a background thread,
so the host should poll `getUpscalerStatus` to drive its UI:

| `activeBackend` | Meaning |
|-----------------|---------|
| `off` | No mode requested. |
| `building` | Kernels compiling (first use of a mode); frames render unscaled until ready. |
| `inactive` | Mode requested but not applied this frame — e.g. the video is not displayed above its source resolution, or the source is HDR (upscaler runs on SDR luma only). |
| `scalar` | Running on the portable scalar backend (non-Apple-Silicon GPUs). |
| `simdgroupMatrix` | Running on the `simdgroup_matrix` backend (Apple Silicon default). |

The upscaler only engages when the drawable shows the video larger than its
source resolution, so a 1080p source in a 1080p (or smaller) view stays
`inactive`. C4F16 is the real-time recommendation; C4F32 is higher quality but
needs an M-Pro/Max-class GPU at 1080p input. See `docs/architecture.md` for the
renderer-side design.

## Ownership Rule

Flutter owns layout and controls. Erika owns the video plane, subtitle plane,
danmaku plane, audio, and timing. The plugin bridges commands and events through
a `MethodChannel`; rendering never passes through Dart.
